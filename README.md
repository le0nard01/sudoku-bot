### Sudoku Bot [Generating sudoku and solving it by some methods]
 
Version 1.0.1
The project is to make a robot that solves Sudoku by some methods, for example Artificial Intelligence.
I needed a platform to study machine learning, and I'm developing this app just for that.

The project's focus has not yet been implemented.
